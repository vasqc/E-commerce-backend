# E-commerce-backend


For this Challenge, we were given some starter code. MySQL, Sequalize and the .ENV package are the main components for the construction of the E-Commerce back-end.
Once the neccessary information was provided, you will need to run schema.sql and seed.sql in order to create a database that is filled with the data.
Insomnia is used to make sure all given endpoints are in fully functional operation.
